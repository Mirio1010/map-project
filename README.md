# 🗺️ Map Project

## Overview

This project is an interactive map application that allows users to drop pins on locations they want to remember or share. Each pin can include tags, descriptions, and optional date/time details. Users can explore locations added by friends, filter pins by category, and view only the spots currently visible within their map view.

The goal is to create a social and personalized map experience — making it easy to discover events, places, and meaningful locations through a shared, interactive map.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React (JSX), Tailwind CSS, JavaScript
- **Maps:** Leaflet
- **Backend/Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL + Authentication)
- **Hosting:** Vercel or Netlify (coming 12/14)
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## Supabase Authentication (local setup)

To enable authentication with Supabase, add the following environment variables to a `.env` file at the project root (Vite expects `VITE_` prefixes):

- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` — your Supabase project URL
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` — your Supabase anon/public key

Example `.env` (do not commit this file):

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://xyzcompany.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

Install new dependencies and run the dev server:

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173/` and you'll see a landing page with Sign In and Sign Up flows that use Supabase. After signing in or signing up, the app navigates to `/app` where the main map UI remains.

## Team

This project is developed as part of the **CUNY Tech Prep Fellowship (2025–2026 Cohort)** by a collaborative student team across multiple CUNY campuses.
