# 🗺️ Map Project

## Overview
Map Project is a web application that explores how maps and geolocation can be used to solve everyday problems. The goal is to provide users with an interactive map that displays relevant nearby resources, starting with simple examples and expanding to more useful features as the project develops.  

## Features (Planned)
- 📍 **Interactive Map** – Display points of interest on a map  
- 🧭 **Geolocation** – Detect and center the map on the user’s current location  
- 🔍 **Resource Discovery** – Show nearby amenities or resources (e.g., restrooms, study spaces, water fountains, food)  
- ⚡ **Filters & Details** – Provide additional context such as accessibility, hours, or distance  
- 🌱 **Extensibility** – Built to expand into different resource types depending on user needs  

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript  
- **Maps:** Leaflet / Mapbox / Google Maps API  
- **Backend/Database:** Supabase or Firebase (for location data and user contributions)  
- **Hosting:** Vercel or Netlify  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
